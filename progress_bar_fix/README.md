# MOA Progress Bar Fix

This fix addresses the issue where the progress bar continues to be displayed even after the MOA (Mixture of Agents) response generation is complete.

## The Problem

When using the MOA model to generate responses, the progress bar at the top of the page would not disappear after the response was generated, leading to confusion for users.

## The Solution

The fix adds multiple safeguards to ensure the progress indicator state variables are properly reset:

1. Added code to reset progress indicators before starting MOA generation
2. Added code to explicitly clear progress indicators after MOA generation completes
3. Made sure all related state variables are properly reset when any operation completes
4. Added cleanup for single-item MOA generation in addition to bulk generation

## Files Changed

- `ViewData.tsx` - Updated the progress indicator handling in multiple functions

## How to Apply

Copy the `ViewData.tsx` file to your project's `client/src/pages/` directory.
